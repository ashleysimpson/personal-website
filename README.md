# personal-website

Simply a personal website for myself. I hope to extend upon this over time but for now you can see the website at [ashleysimpson.dev](https://ashleysimpson.dev).

## Technical Stack

- Using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting

## Design Inspiration

I am no designer, let's start with that. But I have been trying to be more mindful of design and accessibility in my work so I went through `Design for Developers` a `Frontend Masters` course by Sarah Drasner for my design inspiration. I followed a fairly simple process for this but if you want to know more please check out this [repo](https://github.com/ashleysimpson/website-design).

## Running The Website Locally

You know the drill.

- `yarn` or `npm install` for dependencies.
- `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to run the development build.
- `yarn build` or `npm run build` if you want to build the `public` folder. After that you can run something like `npx serve public` to see the website in all it's glory.
